The Department continued providing necessary immigration services amid the pandemic, thanks to the dedication and creativity of its staff. Key initiatives included the introduction of an online registration renewal system, pre-clearance schemes, and focus on reducing processing backlogs.\n\n### Chapter 2: How immigration services met the challenges of COVID-19\n\n#### Residence: Living in Ireland for work, study, or family reasons\nBy 2020 end, there were 157,207 non-EEA nationals with permission to reside in Ireland. Notable advancements included a new online system for Dublin-based non-EEA students and others to renew immigration registration, which significantly helped streamline and enhance the efficiency of the renewal process during the pandemic closures.\n\n#### Visas: Visiting Ireland for short or long stays\nThe number of visa applications decreased significantly in 2020 due to travel restrictions. Notably, a temporary suspension of the Short Stay Visa Waiver Programme and modifications in the Preclearance process were implemented to adjust to pandemic conditions.\n\n#### Citizenship\nThe pandemic necessitated a shift from in-person to virtual citizenship ceremonies, with the first-ever virtual ceremony taking place on July 10, 2020, attended by 21 applicants. Moving forward, declarations of loyalty temporarily replaced ceremonies to ensure continued processing of citizenship applications.\n\n### Chapter 3: The international protection system during COVID-19\n\n#### Applications for international protection\nIn 2020, applications for international protection decreased due to the pandemic. However, the IPO continued to operate, considering international obligations and ensuring the necessary service availability for applicants claiming international protection.\n\n### Chapter 4: Customer Service Summary\n\n- Detailed performance and service metrics are reviewed in this chapter. (Details not provided in the excerpt).\n\n### Chapter 5: Looking ahead to 2021\n\n#### The year ahead\nThe roadmap for 2021 includes further digital reform, development of a long-term migration strategy, and resumption of citizenship ceremonies whenever feasible. Additionally, a regularisation scheme for long-term undocumented individuals is anticipated to be launched in the second half of the year.\n\n### Glossary\n\n- Terms related to immigration services such as asylum seeker, citizenship, EU programs, and more are defined. These definitions provide clarity on various terms used throughout the document related to immigration policies and procedures in Ireland. \n\nThis document provides a comprehensive overview of the immigration landscape in Ireland during the tumultuous time of the COVID-19 pandemic, outlining the challenges faced and adaptations made by the ISD to continue providing essential immigration services.",

        "text": "**A Guide to Buying a Car in Ireland**\n\nPurchasing a car in Ireland can be a smooth and rewarding experience when approached correctly. Here\u2019s a comprehensive guide to help you make an informed decision:\n\n**1. Choose a Reputable Dealer**\n\n- Buying from a trusted car dealer offers peace of mind, a warranty, and reliable after-sales support.\n\n**2. Research the Car**\n- **Vehicle History:** Check the car\u2019s history on platforms like MotorCheck.ie or Cartell.ie to identify issues such as outstanding finance, past accidents, or mileage discrepancies.\n- **Set a Budget:** Consider not only the purchase price but also insurance, road tax, fuel, and potential repairs.\n\n**3.

The types of tax basis include:\n- **Cumulative Basis:** Used normally for payroll tax calculations. It cumulates all income and tax credits from the previous January 1st to ensure correct tax payment and the application of all applicable tax credits.\n- **Week 1 Basis:** Under this method, tax is calculated on a week-by-week basis without accumulating credits or applying rate bands retroactively to January 1st. It prevents refunds until a cumulative Tax Credit Certificate (TCC) is issued. Reasons for using this include significant reductions in tax credits, insufficient prior employment data, or undisclosed employment details.\n- **Emergency Basis:** Applied in specific cases, such as when an employer does not have the employee's PPSN or registration for PAYE is missing.\n\n**Example:**\n#### John's Tax Calculation as a PAYE Employee for 2025\n- **Status:** Single\n- **Tax Credits and Rate Band for 2025:**\n  - Single Person\u2019s Tax Credit: \u20ac2,000\n  - PAYE Tax Credit: \u20ac2,000\n  - Total Tax Credits: \u20ac4,000 per year (\u20ac76.92 per week)\n  - Rate Band: \u20ac44,000 per year (\u20ac846.16 per week)\n\nJohn's Weekly Tax Calculation:\n- **Date:** Paydays 14 and 21 January 2025\n- **Weekly Earnings:** \u20ac600\n- **Details of Calculation:**\n  - Taxed at 20%: \u20ac120 (applied up to the weekly portion of rate band \u20ac846.16)\n  - Taxed at 40%: \u20ac0 (As income is less than the rate band)\n  - Gross Tax: \u20ac120\n  - Less Tax Credits: \u20ac76.92\n  - **Tax Payable: \u20ac43.08**\n\nFor further clarifications or if you find yourself on the Week 1 basis at year-end, use the MyEnquiries service in myAccount to contact Revenue or submit an income tax return via \u2018PAYE Services\u2019 in myAccount to review your annual tax situation.",

        "text": "**Biometrics**\n\n1. **Home**\n2. **Biometrics**\n\n**In This Section:**\n\n- **Introduction**\n- **Countries in which visa applicants are required to provide their biometrics**\n- **Capture of biometric information**\n- **Children**\n- **Missing fingers**\n- **Injured or decorated fingers**\n- **Refusal to give biometric information**\n- **Storage of biometric information**\n- **Arrival in Ireland**\n- **Access to your biometric records**\n- **Sharing of biometric information**\n\n### Introduction\n\nBiometric information includes:\n- Measurements or other assessments of physical characteristics,\n- Information about these characteristics held in automated form.\n\nThe provision of biometric information allows the identity of a person to be investigated or ascertained. This typically involves capturing fingerprints and, in some cases, a digital image of your face.\n\n### Countries in which visa applicants are required to provide their biometrics\n\nResidents living in China, Hong Kong, India, Nigeria, or Pakistan must provide their fingerprints each time they apply for a visa to Ireland, unless exempted. This requirement may be extended to other locations in the future.\n\n### Capture of biometric information\n\nBiometric information is captured at an Irish visa application centre (VAC). Applicants, except those exempt, must appear in person at a VAC operated by VFS Global. Appointment details are provided in the application summary form.\n\nThe process involves electronically scanning all fingers and thumb of each hand. The equipment used complies with international safety standards and does not require ink, liquids, or chemicals.\n\n### Children\n\nChildren aged 5 years and above must provide fingerprints and appear at the VAC. Those aged between 5 and 17 years should be accompanied by a parent/guardian or responsible adult.

Applicants, except those exempt, must appear in person at a VAC operated by VFS Global. Appointment details are provided in the application summary form.\n\nThe process involves electronically scanning all fingers and thumb of each hand. The equipment used complies with international safety standards and does not require ink, liquids, or chemicals.\n\n### Children\n\nChildren aged 5 years and above must provide fingerprints and appear at the VAC. Those aged between 5 and 17 years should be accompanied by a parent/guardian or responsible adult.

Introduction**\nThe British Irish Visa Scheme allows individuals to travel within the Common Travel Area (CTA), comprising Ireland and the United Kingdom (except the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands), on a single visa intended for short stays. To participate in this scheme, the visa must be endorsed with 'BIVS'. Visa officers determine eligibility for endorsement, and their decision is final without an appeal option.\n\n**2. Eligibility**\n- **Chinese Nationals**: Must be residing in China, Hong Kong, or Macau at the time of application.\n- **Indian Nationals**: Must be residing in India at the time of application.\n\n**3. Eligible Visas**\n- **UK Visas**:\n  - Permitted Paid Engagement visas.\n  - All standard visitor categories for visits up to six months, excluding \u2018visitor in transit\u2019 and \u2018visitor for marriage or civil partnership\u2019 visas.\n- **Irish Visas**:\n  - Visit (family/friend)\n  - Visit (tourist)\n  - Conference/Event\n  - Business\n\n**4. Further Information**\nTo utilize the BIVS, one must first enter the country that issued the visa. For instance, holders of an Irish visa must initially travel to Ireland, whereas holders of a British visa must first visit the UK.\n\n- **Single Entry Visas**: A 'BIVS' endorsed single entry visa permits one entry to the CTA. Multiple travels between Ireland and the UK are allowed as part of a single trip. Entry should be via the country that issued the visa, though exit can be from either country.\n\n- **Multiple Entry Visas**:\n  - **Irish Visa Scheme**: Entry into the CTA must always begin with Ireland. Subsequent entries into the CTA after leaving must also start with Ireland. Stays can be up to 90 days as determined by Irish immigration officers.\n  - **UK Visa Scheme**: If you have entered the UK, or if UK immigration has allowed you to stay (up to 180 days), and your visit to Ireland ends before your UK stay, you may travel to Ireland directly from a third country without needing to return to the UK first. The stay in Ireland can last up to 90 days or until your UK permission expires, whichever is shorter.\n\n**Important Notes**:\n- Having an eligible British or Irish visa under this program allows travel to Ireland for up to 90 days but does not guarantee entry.\n- For travelers arriving via Northern Ireland's border, it's mandatory to report to an Immigration Officer at the Dundalk Immigration Office, Dublin Airport or Port, or a local Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na (police) immigration office within 30 days of arrival, or within 7 days if engaging in business or employment.\n- The maximum allowable stay in Ireland is the shorter period of either 90 days or until the end of the UK permission.\n- While in Ireland, visits can be frequent within the approved duration, which will be stamped on your passport upon arrival. When applying for an Irish visa, applicants must prove Ireland is their primary destination.\n\nThis outline intends to clarify the application and usage of the British Irish Visa Scheme for potential and current applicants.",

Other Relevant Provisions**  \nAddressing topics like worker transfers within enterprises, ensuring continuity of employment conditions post-transfer, and specific provisions related to cross-border employment settings.\n\nThis guide is designed to be a reference document for both employers and employees to understand their rights and obligations under Irish employment law and aims to facilitate compliance and awareness to foster fair work environments.\n\nFor further information, these individuals and entities can contact:\n- Workplace Relations Commission, O\u2019Brien Road, Carlow, Ireland.\n- Lo-call: 0818 808090, or visit www.workplacerelations.ie\n\n**Important Note**: This guide should not be considered a complete or authoritative statement of law.",

The calculation is done as follows:\n- Apply the standard rate of 20% to the income within your weekly rate band.\n- Apply the higher rate of 40% to any income above your weekly rate band.\n- Add the above amounts.\n- Deduct the amount of your weekly tax credits from this total.\n\nThis method holds whether you are paid weekly, fortnightly, or monthly.

This measure is designed to facilitate the swift exit and support for Ukrainian family members of Irish citizens, as well as family members of Ukrainians residing in Ireland. \n\nThe emergency measure, enabled by the issuance of a Statutory Instrument, takes immediate effect, allowing all Ukrainians travelling to Ireland to do so without the necessity of a visa. Ukrainian citizens considering exiting Ukraine can now enter Ireland visa-free for the coming period, provided they deem it safe to travel. On arrival, they will have 90 days to regularize their immigration status. The effectiveness and impact of this new regulation will be closely monitored and reviewed continually.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that non-Ukrainian nationals residing in Ukraine who require a visa to enter Ireland still need to obtain one. They can apply through the Irish Embassy network in the neighboring countries of Ukraine as per usual procedures.\n\nFor further travel advice and updates, travelers can visit the Department of Foreign Affairs website at www.dfa.ie/travel, especially those planning journeys through or to the neighboring countries.\n\n---",

Ukrainian citizens considering exiting Ukraine can now enter Ireland visa-free for the coming period, provided they deem it safe to travel. On arrival, they will have 90 days to regularize their immigration status. The effectiveness and impact of this new regulation will be closely monitored and reviewed continually.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that non-Ukrainian nationals residing in Ukraine who require a visa to enter Ireland still need to obtain one. They can apply through the Irish Embassy network in the neighboring countries of Ukraine as per usual procedures.",
            "However, it is important to note that non-Ukrainian nationals residing in Ukraine who require a visa to enter Ireland still need to obtain one.

        "text": "# EU Treaty Rights Division \n## Impact of Brexit on UK Nationals and their non-EEA National Family Members Residing in Ireland\n\n### Target Audience\nThis information pertains to:\n- UK nationals and their non-EEA family members who were residing in Ireland at the end of the Brexit transition period on 31 December 2020.\n- Non-EEA nationals who have submitted applications (including review applications) to Immigration Service Delivery for residence in Ireland as a family member of a UK national.\n- Persons who currently hold a valid EU Treaty Rights residence permission on the basis of their relationship with a UK National.\n- Non-EEA national family members of UK nationals entering Ireland post-31 December 2020.\n\n### Frequently Asked Questions\n\n#### Q1: What does Brexit mean for UK nationals living in Ireland?\n**A:** UK nationals living in Ireland will see no change in their status. The protections provided by the Common Travel Area (CTA) allow UK nationals to continue to travel freely, live, work, and access education, healthcare, and social services in Ireland, and vice versa for Irish citizens in the UK.\n\n#### Q2: Is the CTA dependent on Brexit?\n**A:** No, the CTA predates both Irish and UK membership of the EU and is independent of it. The Irish and UK Governments have reaffirmed their commitment to maintaining the CTA under all circumstances.\n\n#### Q3: Do UK nationals need documentation to reside in Ireland post-Brexit?\n**A:** No, but UK nationals may request a Withdrawal Agreement Beneficiary residence document, which is free and can be obtained through local Registration Offices.\n\n#### Q4: Will there be changes for Non-EEA family members of UK nationals in Ireland?\n**A:** Non-EEA family members residing in Ireland before the end of the transition period can continue with the same residence permission. They will need to replace their IRP Card with a new document stating their beneficiary status under the Withdrawal Agreement before 30 June 2022.\n\n#### Q5: Is there a fee for the online application for a replacement card?\n**A:** No, there is no fee.\n\n#### Q6: How will the new IRP Card/Withdrawal Agreement Beneficiary Card be delivered?\n**A:** It will be sent by Express Post to the provided address, expected within 5-10 working days after finalizing the application.\n\nFor further detailed inquiries, UK nationals and non-EEA family members can refer to questions regarding specific documentation needs, residence permissions, and impacts of Brexit on travel and residence rights within the EU.\n\n### Note:\nApplications and documentation can be processed through the Immigration Service of the Department of Justice, and further information is available through their official website. For specific cases and additional support, inquiries can be addressed directly to the designated email addresses provided in the FAQs.",

Students enrolled for longer are seen as attending separate one-year courses annually.\n- **Annual Registrations**:\n  - Registrations must be renewed every year.\n\n**Different Scenarios Based on Registration Expiry**:\n- **Before 1 January 2011**:\n  - Students follow previous system rules, may enroll in any subsequent courses agreeing to conditions from new regulations effective 1 January 2011.\n  \n- **On or After 1 January 2011**:\n  - **Language and Non-Degree Programme**:\n    - Students with less than 3 years of student registration may continue any current or new language/non-degree courses up to a 3-year immigration limit.\n    - Students with 3 years or more of registration can only re-register for continuing non-language courses at NFQ 5 or 6; subsequent study limited to degree programs.\n  \n  - **Degree Programme Students (NFQ 7 +)**:\n    - Students with less than 7 years of registration can renew annually until the 7th year; completion allowed if already in the course.\n    - Students with 7 years or more of registration can only re-register if in the continuing years of their degree programme; further study possible if meeting specific criteria.\n\n**Timed-Out Students**:\n- Allowed a special non-renewable 6-month extension if their registration expires between 1 January and 30 June 2011.\n- Can work during this period under the same conditions as academic holidays.\n- May apply for an employment permit without returning to their country of origin.\n\n**Additional Measures**:\n- **Unaccompanied Minors**:\n  - Placements in non-fee-paying schools prohibited except for those existing in the system until the end of July 2011.\n  - Future placements must be in fee-paying schools with permitted entry for the 2010-11 school year, allowed up to end of July 2012.\n- **Children of Students**:\n  - Must attend fee-paying schools unless already registered in a free system, permitted until their parent's study completion or until July 2011, whichever is earlier.\n\n**Examples Illustrating Registration Scenarios**:\n- **Student A** (Language Student expired before 2011) can enroll for another year under new conditions; must transition to NFQ Level 7+ for further stay beyond.\n- **Student B** (Registered until April 2011 as Further Education Student) can finish course until 2012, then must enroll in NFQ Level 7+.\n- **Student C** (English Language Student expiring July 2011 and wishing to continue) can't enroll in new courses unless they're at NFQ Level 7 or higher.\n- **Student D** and **E** (Degree Students) facing potential 7-year rule can complete their ongoing courses; plans for higher-level courses must be in place if wishing longer stay.\n- **Student F** (Exceeding allowable study period) receives a 6-month extension but cannot re-register as a student afterward.\n  \n**Note on Employment**:\n- Students are not permitted to be self-employed, and no changes are currently planned to this policy.\n\n**Conclusion**:\n- All transitional arrangements are under standard immigration controls and require progression in studies without seeking to extend stay through prolonged education.",

            "For more comprehensive details on implementation and transitional arrangements for existing and new students, refer to the specific sections and appendices outlined in the table of contents.\n\n--- \n\n**Contact Information for Further Queries**\nFor detailed understanding and further inquiries, stakeholders are directed to visit the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service website or directly consult the specific departments involved outlined in the Appendix 2 of the committee members.\n\n**Notes on Handling Non-EEA Students' Immigration Matters**\n\n1. **General Information**:\n   - This document pertains only to non-EEA nationals registered as students.\n   - It does not restrict any other immigration rights non-EEA students may hold.\n   - Main focus is on immigration-related issues; however, students must also adhere to employment regulations and tax obligations.\n\n**Transitional Provisions For Existing Students**:\n- **Language Courses**:\n  - Considered to have a maximum duration of 1 year. Students enrolled for longer are seen as attending separate one-year courses annually.\n- **Annual Registrations**:\n  - Registrations must be renewed every year.",
            "**Different Scenarios Based on Registration Expiry**:\n- **Before 1 January 2011**:\n  - Students follow previous system rules, may enroll in any subsequent courses agreeing to conditions from new regulations effective 1 January 2011.\n  \n- **On or After 1 January 2011**:\n  - **Language and Non-Degree Programme**:\n    - Students with less than 3 years of student registration may continue any current or new language/non-degree courses up to a 3-year immigration limit.\n    - Students with 3 years or more of registration can only re-register for continuing non-language courses at NFQ 5 or 6; subsequent study limited to degree programs.\n  \n  - **Degree Programme Students (NFQ 7 +)**:\n    - Students with less than 7 years of registration can renew annually until the 7th year; completion allowed if already in the course.\n    - Students with 7 years or more of registration can only re-register if in the continuing years of their degree programme; further study possible if meeting specific criteria.",
            "**Timed-Out Students**:\n- Allowed a special non-renewable 6-month extension if their registration expires between 1 January and 30 June 2011.\n- Can work during this period under the same conditions as academic holidays.\n- May apply for an employment permit without returning to their country of origin.\n\n**Additional Measures**:\n- **Unaccompanied Minors**:\n  - Placements in non-fee-paying schools prohibited except for those existing in the system until the end of July 2011.\n  - Future placements must be in fee-paying schools with permitted entry for the 2010-11 school year, allowed up to end of July 2012.\n- **Children of Students**:\n  - Must attend fee-paying schools unless already registered in a free system, permitted until their parent's study completion or until July 2011, whichever is earlier.",
            "**Examples Illustrating Registration Scenarios**:\n- **Student A** (Language Student expired before 2011) can enroll for another year under new conditions; must transition to NFQ Level 7+ for further stay beyond.\n- **Student B** (Registered until April 2011 as Further Education Student) can finish course until 2012, then must enroll in NFQ Level 7+.\n- **Student C** (English Language Student expiring July 2011 and wishing to continue) can't enroll in new courses unless they're at NFQ Level 7 or higher.\n- **Student D** and **E** (Degree Students) facing potential 7-year rule can complete their ongoing courses; plans for higher-level courses must be in place if wishing longer stay.\n- **Student F** (Exceeding allowable study period) receives a 6-month extension but cannot re-register as a student afterward.\n  \n**Note on Employment**:\n- Students are not permitted to be self-employed, and no changes are currently planned to this policy.\n\n**Conclusion**:\n- All transitional arrangements are under standard immigration controls and require progression in studies without seeking to extend stay through prolonged education.\n\nThe text extracted from the image reads:",

The Irish higher education sector is thereby tasked with mobilizing resources to meet the needs of international students effectively.\n\n---\n\n### Aims of this Briefing Paper\n\nThis document presents findings from a survey of international students who studied in Ireland during 2015. It aims to enhance understanding of these students' experiences to support and refine educational policies and practices.\n\n---\n\n### Methodology\n\nAn online survey was implemented across five institutions, designed based on a comprehensive literature review and insights from a webinar on international student issues. The survey, conducted from April to June 2015, gathered 573 responses and focused on demographic characteristics, pre-arrival knowledge about Ireland, and in-country experiences.\n\n---\n\n### Profile of Respondents\n\nAmong the 3,584 international students across the participating institutions, responses were as follows:\n\n- Institute of Technology, Carlow: 110 (37%)\n- Cork Institute of Technology: 69 (26%)\n- University College Cork: 278 (12%)\n- Institute of Technology, Tralee: 69 (23%)\n- Waterford Institute of Technology: 43 (10%)\n\n---\n\n### Findings\n\nStudents had varied degrees of knowledge about practical living aspects and Irish culture before arriving. Many felt well informed about Ireland's geography and housing but less so about healthcare, employment, and banking. Insights into Irish social settings, cultural norms, and specific college-related systems were areas highlighted for improvement.\n\n---\n\n### Experiences of Irish Higher Education\n\nStudents noted differences in academic expectations, assessment methods, and classroom interactions compared to their home countries. Institutions generally provided helpful orientations and ongoing support, which positively impacted students' adaptation to the academic and social environment in Ireland.\n\n---\n\n### Discussion\n\nThe findings underscore the importance of pre-arrival preparation on cultural, social, and practical matters for international students. Enhancing informational resources on academic and institutional norms can further facilitate smoother transitions and enrich students' educational experiences in Ireland.\n\n---\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nThanks to the contributions of the Live and Learn in Ireland team and support from the National Forum.

It aims to provide clearer, more comprehensive, and transparent guidelines to assist applicants and decision-makers in this area.

Introduction**\nOutlines the purpose of the document, noting the increase in non-Irish nationals in Ireland and the need for a unified policy on family reunification. Addresses the lack of a single overarching policy, aiming instead to solidify guidelines that govern various scenarios under family reunification.\n\n**2. A Balancing of Rights**\nDiscusses the necessity of balancing individual rights with community interests, guided by the European Convention on Human Rights and other legal frameworks. It emphasizes that rights to family life do not equate to automatic rights to family reunification.\n\n**3.

Key Policy Issues**\n\n**4. Nature of Family?**\nDefines different family categories for the purposes of reunification and the underlying principles affecting their eligibility for reunification requests.\n\n**5. Differentiated Family Reunification**\nDescribes how the residency status of the sponsor affects reunification chances, with an emphasis on avoiding automatic or unconditional reunification.\n\n**6. Reconstituting the Family Unit**\nDiscusses considerations for families that have been long separated and the implications for reunification policies.\n\n**7. Public Security, Public Policy, and Public Health**\nDetails circumstances under which an application for family reunification would be refused based on public security, policy, or health risks.\n\n**8. Economic Impact**\nDescribes the economic considerations in weighing family reunification decisions, including sponsor's responsibilities and potential public burdens.\n\n**9. Integration Requirements**\nConsiders potential integration requirements such as language proficiency and understanding of Irish society, acknowledging their increasing inclusion in family reunification policies across the EU.\n\n**10. Preclearance**\nProposes a preclearance requirement to address challenges with non-visa-required applications and streamline process consistency.\n\n**11. Processing & Fees**\nIntroduces a standard application form and fee to cover processing costs, reflecting the labor-intensive nature of handling reunification cases.\n\n**B. Detailed Guidelines:** Comprehensive guidelines detailing qualifications for sponsors, definitions of family members, dependencies, and financial requirements, among other specific criteria.\n\n**Appendices:**\n- **Appendix A**: Guidelines on DNA sampling for family reunification.\n- **Appendix B**: Guidelines on parental consent in family reunification cases.\n\n**Implementation:**\nOutlines the timeline and approach for the policy's implementation starting from 1 January 2017, emphasizing gradual organizational changes and future detailed guidelines to be available online.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis document strives to balance individual familial desires with national policy, ensuring public interests are safeguarded while providing a clear, standardized approach to family reunification.\n",

It helps to create socio-cultural stability facilitating the integration of third country nationals in the Member State, which also serves to promote economic and social cohesion, a fundamental Community objective stated in the Treaty.\u2019\n\nNotwithstanding the non-binding nature of these sources, it is desirable in the view of the Court, that the provisions of S. 18 should be construed and applied so far as statutory interpretation permits in a manner which is consistent with these policies and with the consensus apparent among the Member States of the Union in the objectives of the Council Directive.\n\n---\n\n**Family Reunification Data from 2011 to 2016:**\n\n- Family members applied for:\n  - 2011: 990\n  - 2012: 732\n  - 2013: 704\n  - 2014: 353\n  - 2015: 713\n  - 2016: 756\n\n- Family members granted:\n  - 2011: 547\n  - 2012: 389\n  - 2013: 207\n  - 2014: 229\n  - 2015: 328\n  - 2016: 406\n\n- Family members refused:\n  - 2011: 195\n  - 2012: 300\n  - 2013: 395\n  - 2014: 83\n  - 2015: 295\n  - 2016: 277\n\n---\n\n**Net Family Income Eligibility for Dependent Children:**\n\n- 1 child: \u20ac511\n- 2 children: \u20ac612\n- 3 children: \u20ac713\n- 4 children: \u20ac834\n- 5 children: \u20ac960\n- 6 children: \u20ac1,076\n- 7 children: \u20ac1,212\n- 8 children: \u20ac1,308\n\n---\n\n**Documentation Required for Family Reunification:**\n\n- **Spouse:**\n  - Divorce/death certificate of previous spouse(s) (if applicable)\n  - Marriage/civil partnership certificate\n  - Relationship history if not residing together since the union\n- **Children:**\n  - Current passport-sized photos\n  - Statement of Parental Authorization from the other parent if not traveling together\n  - Death certificate of the other parent (if applicable)\n  - Evidence of sole legal guardianship\n  - Letter of authorization from the current guardian\n- **De Facto Partner:**\n  - Evidence of the existence and durability of the relationship\n  - Full account of relationship history\n- **Other Dependent Relatives:**\n  - Current photos and birth dates (if applicable)\n  - Marriage, death/divorce certificates (if applicable)\n  - Court documented custodial rights\n  - Evidence of financial and physical/mental dependency\n  - Details of living costs and other family members in the country of residence\n\n---\n\n**Applications for Visas for Family Reasons (2011-2016 by Sponsor Type):**\n\n- **Irish Sponsor:** Applications ranged from 296 (2011) to 77 (2016)\n- **EEA Sponsor:** Applications showed a decrease from 185 (2011) to 5,603 (2016)\n- **Non-EEA Sponsor:** Showed an overall increase, with 1,349 applications in 2011 up to 2,787 in 2016\n\n---\n\n**Total Visa Applications and Approvals:**\n\n- From 2011 to 2016, total applications ranged from 83,437 in 2011 to 124,225 in 2016\n- Approvals varied significantly across years, particularly seeing a shift in the number of visas granted for family-based reasons\n\n---\n\nThis document covers data and information on family reunification processes, including court outcomes, application procedures, and statistical data regarding application submissions and outcomes by nationality and sponsorship type.",

In Hamza, J.

            "The rationale of family reunification as an objective in this area is well expressed in Recital (4) to the Council Directive:\n\n\u2018Family reunification is a necessary way of making family life possible. It helps to create socio-cultural stability facilitating the integration of third country nationals in the Member State, which also serves to promote economic and social cohesion, a fundamental Community objective stated in the Treaty.\u2019\n\nNotwithstanding the non-binding nature of these sources, it is desirable in the view of the Court, that the provisions of S. 18 should be construed and applied so far as statutory interpretation permits in a manner which is consistent with these policies and with the consensus apparent among the Member States of the Union in the objectives of the Council Directive.\n\n---\n\n**Family Reunification Data from 2011 to 2016:**\n\n- Family members applied for:\n  - 2011: 990\n  - 2012: 732\n  - 2013: 704\n  - 2014: 353\n  - 2015: 713\n  - 2016: 756\n\n- Family members granted:\n  - 2011: 547\n  - 2012: 389\n  - 2013: 207\n  - 2014: 229\n  - 2015: 328\n  - 2016: 406\n\n- Family members refused:\n  - 2011: 195\n  - 2012: 300\n  - 2013: 395\n  - 2014: 83\n  - 2015: 295\n  - 2016: 277",

The Interim List of Eligible Programmes (ILEP) was introduced as a restrictive list of education programmes eligible for student immigration purposes, used as a reference for Immigration Service Delivery (ISD) of the Department of Justice, in considering visa and residency applications from non-EEA applicants wishing to study full-time in Ireland.  \n\nThe ILEP includes programmes meeting specific criteria enabling providers to recruit non-EEA students to study full-time in Ireland. New overseas accredited/validated programmes or further education or vocational education and training programmes are not included in the ILEP, which is closed to new providers. Current providers must comply with all criteria and immigration requirements to retain their programme listing. The ILEP is administered by the Department of Justice with advisory input from the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science (DFHERIS).  \n\nThe QQI will eventually replace the ILEP with the International Education Mark (IEM), ensuring providers meet national standards for international learners. Providers must comply with immigration laws and ensure all students are aware of their immigration obligations.\n\n### Section 2: Programme Requirements  \n\n**Categories of Programmes in the ILEP:**  \n- Higher education programmes leading to major awards  \n- Higher education programmes leading to non-major awards  \n- Professional awards  \n- English language programmes  \n- Foundation programmes  \n\n**Specific Criteria for English Language Programmes:**  \nMust be:\n- Minimum of 25 weeks within 7 months\n- 15 hours of classroom tuition per week\n- Define learning pathway with outcomes and assessments\n- Exclusively for non-native speakers\n- End with a proficiency exam or recognised ELT award\n\n**Table 1: English language proficiency exams** outlines various exams recognized under the ILEP along with their required minimum scores.\n\n**Provider Requirements:**  \nProviders must demonstrate capacity, resources, expertise, and a satisfactory track record in education and immigration compliance. They also need to ensure programmes are promoted accurately, and listed in the ILEP before recruitment.\n\n### Section 3: Providers listed in the ILEP  \n\nExisting providers can continue recruitment under strict compliance. New providers cannot be added. Changes in provider ownership affecting the legal entity must be reported to ISD promptly.\n\n### Additional Sections on Requirements of Providers, Other Conditions, Protections for Students, Teaching and Learning, Student Services, and Premises and Related Resources elaborate on operational standards, administrative duties, legal compliance, student protection strategies, teaching methodologies, and enrolment processes that providers must adhere to.\n\n### Section 6: Operation of the ILEP  \n\nIncludes details on application cycles, process, monitoring, inspections, investigations, and conditions under which programmes may be removed from the ILEP or suspended.\n\nFor complete regulations and details, refer to the specific sections as per the official ISD documentation. Ensure compliance with all listed requirements to maintain eligibility and operational status within the ILEP framework.",

Under the PAYE system, your tax rate bands are spread evenly throughout the year.\n- Paid weekly: 52 equal weekly amounts.\n- Paid fortnightly: 26 equal fortnightly amounts.\n- Paid monthly: 12 equal monthly amounts.\n- Paid every four weeks: 13 equal amounts.\n\n**Unused Rate Bands:**\nYou cannot get a refund of any unused rate bands, and they cannot be carried over into another tax year.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n**Example 1: Ann in 2025**\n- **Status:** Single, earns \u20ac900 per week.\n- **Standard Rate Band:** \u20ac44,000 annually; \u20ac846.16 weekly.\n- **Tax Calculation:**\n  - Standard rate band: \u20ac846.16 at 20% = \u20ac169.23\n  - Balance: \u20ac53.84 at 40% = \u20ac21.54\n\n**Example 2: Colin in 2025**\n- **Status:** Single, earns \u20ac800 per week.\n- **Standard Rate Band:** \u20ac44,000 annually; \u20ac846.16 weekly.\n- **Tax Calculation:**\n  - Entire income taxed at the standard rate: \u20ac800 at 20% = \u20ac160\n  - No balance for higher tax rate.\n\n**Example 3: Aoife in 2025**\n- **Status:** Single, earns \u20ac4,000 per month.\n- **Standard Rate Band:** \u20ac44,000 annually; \u20ac3,666.67 monthly.\n- **Tax Calculation:**\n  - Standard rate band: \u20ac3,666.67 at 20% = \u20ac733.33\n  - Balance: \u20ac333.33 at 40% = \u20ac133.33\n\n**What is an Increased Rate Band?**\nFor couples in a marriage or civil partnership, the standard rate band is \u20ac53,000. If both work, it may be increased to a maximum of \u20ac88,000 depending on individual incomes.\n\n**Example 4: Sarah and Alex**\n- **Status:** Married, both employed under joint assessment.\n- **Incomes:** Sarah \u20ac71,000; Alex \u20ac22,500 (lower earner).\n- **Rate Band:** Increased by the income of the lower earner: \u20ac53,000 + \u20ac22,500 = \u20ac75,500.\n\n**Example 5: Oonagh and Donna**\n- **Status:** In a civil partnership and taxed under joint assessment.\n- **Incomes:** Oonagh \u20ac54,000; Donna \u20ac35,300.\n- **Rate Band:** Increased by \u20ac35,000 (as the lower income is higher than \u20ac35,000 but still below the max increase): \u20ac53,000 + \u20ac35,000 = \u20ac88,000.\n\n**Note:**\nThe increase in the standard rate band is not allowable where a couple is claiming the Home Carer Tax Credit.",

        "text": "**Guidelines for Health Service Employers on the Recruitment of Non-EEA Nationals under the Work Permits and Working Visa / Work Authorisation Schemes**\n\n**Published by:**\nHealth Service Employers Agency (HSEA)\n63-64 Adelaide Road, Dublin 2\nTel: (01) 6626 966 Fax: (01) 6626 977\n\n**Published Date:** May 2005\n\n**Access Details:**\nDownload Date: 07/02/2025 18:31:08\n[Link to Document](http://hdl.handle.net/10147/44453)\nFor more publications, visit [http://www.lenus.ie/hse](http://www.lenus.ie/hse)\n\n**Disclaimer:**\nThis document is intended for guideline purposes and does not claim to be definitive concerning legislative provisions or obligations.\n\n### Introduction\n\nThis guideline aims to assist health service employers in hiring individuals from outside the European Economic Area (EEA) in compliance with the Employment Permits Act, 2003, and the Employment Equality Acts, 1998 and 2004. It details the essential aspects of the work permit and working visa/work authorisation programmes and how to handle job applications from non-EEA nationals.\n\nEEA nationals are permitted to work across the European Union countries without authorization, including member states plus Norway, Iceland, and Liechtenstein. Certain groups, such as refugees and spouses or parents of Irish citizens, do not require work permits. For a full list of exemptions, see Appendix A.\n\n### Work Permits\n\nIssued by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, work permits require an employer to demonstrate a failed recruitment effort from the Irish or wider EEA labor market before approval. The permit is valid for up to one year and is non-transferable between employers.\n\n#### Work Permit Process\n\n1. Employers should verify if the job is eligible for a work permit (refer to Appendix 1 for ineligible job categories).\n2. Vacancies should be advertised potentially for work permit applications through F\u00c1S/EURES.\n3. Job application forms should denote if a work permit is required.\n4. Process EEA applications first; only consider non-EEA candidates if no suitable EEA candidates are available.\n5. Rank all candidates by merit, with a preference for EEA nationals and non-EEA nationals exempt from permits.\n6. For non-EEA candidates requiring work permits, ensure the vacancy was advertised for four weeks before applying for a work permit.\n7. Special procedures for occupations in short supply may bypass certain advertising requirements (see specifics in Appendix 5).\n8. Inform the prospective non-EEA employee that the job offer is contingent upon securing a work permit.\n\nRenewal applications for work permits should be filed three months prior to existing permit expiration, ensuring all employment conditions have been met.\n\n### Working Visa / Work Authorisation Programme\n\nThis scheme, administered by the Department of Foreign Affairs, is designed to expedite the hiring in sectors experiencing skills shortages, particularly in healthcare and specific IT roles. It governs the assessment and appointment processes to ensure non-EEA individuals eligible for or holding work visas/authorisations are treated on par with EEA nationals.\n\n#### Visa and Immigration Considerations\n\nCertain non-EEA nationals need an entry visa for Ireland (see Appendix 4 for exempt countries).

It details the essential aspects of the work permit and working visa/work authorisation programmes and how to handle job applications from non-EEA nationals.",
            "EEA nationals are permitted to work across the European Union countries without authorization, including member states plus Norway, Iceland, and Liechtenstein. Certain groups, such as refugees and spouses or parents of Irish citizens, do not require work permits. For a full list of exemptions, see Appendix A.\n\n### Work Permits\n\nIssued by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, work permits require an employer to demonstrate a failed recruitment effort from the Irish or wider EEA labor market before approval. The permit is valid for up to one year and is non-transferable between employers.\n\n#### Work Permit Process",
            "#### Work Permit Process\n\n1. Employers should verify if the job is eligible for a work permit (refer to Appendix 1 for ineligible job categories).\n2. Vacancies should be advertised potentially for work permit applications through F\u00c1S/EURES.\n3. Job application forms should denote if a work permit is required.\n4. Process EEA applications first; only consider non-EEA candidates if no suitable EEA candidates are available.\n5. Rank all candidates by merit, with a preference for EEA nationals and non-EEA nationals exempt from permits.\n6. For non-EEA candidates requiring work permits, ensure the vacancy was advertised for four weeks before applying for a work permit.\n7. Special procedures for occupations in short supply may bypass certain advertising requirements (see specifics in Appendix 5).\n8. Inform the prospective non-EEA employee that the job offer is contingent upon securing a work permit.\n\nRenewal applications for work permits should be filed three months prior to existing permit expiration, ensuring all employment conditions have been met.\n\n### Working Visa / Work Authorisation Programme",
            "Renewal applications for work permits should be filed three months prior to existing permit expiration, ensuring all employment conditions have been met.\n\n### Working Visa / Work Authorisation Programme\n\nThis scheme, administered by the Department of Foreign Affairs, is designed to expedite the hiring in sectors experiencing skills shortages, particularly in healthcare and specific IT roles. It governs the assessment and appointment processes to ensure non-EEA individuals eligible for or holding work visas/authorisations are treated on par with EEA nationals.\n\n#### Visa and Immigration Considerations\n\nCertain non-EEA nationals need an entry visa for Ireland (see Appendix 4 for exempt countries). All non-EEA individuals must pass immigration control upon arrival.\n\n### Employment of non-EEA Students\n\nStudents with permissible residence statuses in Ireland can undertake part-time work without a work permit. These rules allow up to 20 hours of work per week during term or full-time during holidays.",

This is typically marked by an immigration stamp placed in your passport upon registering. Note that some permissions may not be entered in your passport. For more information, see the web notice document ([Web Notice PDF](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/web-notice.pdf)).\n\n### Change in Circumstances\n\nSome individuals may need to change their type of immigration permission or stamp if their circumstances change. If you hold valid permission, represented by a current Irish Residence Permit (IRP card), you may be eligible to apply to either extend or vary your permission.\n\nFor example, if you have held a Critical Skills Employment Permit for at least two years, you may be eligible to apply for a different type of permission that provides greater benefits. Remember, an out-of-date permission cannot be changed. Submitting an application does not extend your current permission, so it is crucial to apply well in advance if you meet the criteria.\n\nImmigration stamps and permissions have different criteria and conditions, such as the ability to study, work, or retire in Ireland.

About Labour Market Access Permission\n\nSince July 2018, eligible international protection applicants can apply for a Labour Market Access Permission (LMA Permission). This permission is issued by Immigration Services Delivery (ISD), on behalf of the Minister for Justice.\n\n**Eligibility Criteria:**\n- The applicant must be an international protection applicant in Ireland;\n- Must have waited at least 5 months for a first instance recommendation;\n- Must be cooperating with the international protection process.\n\nA permission becomes valid 6 months after applying for international protection and allows access to employment, self-employment, and vocational training for twelve months, renewable under compliance and ongoing application conditions.\n\n**Application process:** Forms are available on the ISD website. \n[ISD Labour Market Access](http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/inis/pages/labour-market-access)\n\n---\n\n### 2. The Labour Market Access Permission\n\nThe LMA Permission is valid for 12 months and is renewable. It is a double-sided document on watermarked paper featuring the holder's photograph and validity period. Alongside a valid Temporary Residence Certificate (TRC Card), unless under 18 or still awaiting the TRC Card, it must be presented by the holder for employment purposes.\n\nDue to COVID-19, permissions are now issued via email, with the permission number included in the email and a PDF attachment.\n\n**Verification:** Email LMAU at Lmauqueries@justice.ie to confirm the validity of an emailed permission.\n\n---\n\n### 3.

The immigration notice, issued under s. 4(3)(j) of the Immigration Act 2004, cited that their admission was contrary to public policy. Justice Minister, Mr. Dermot Ahern, clarified that the current immigration policy strictly allows only immediate, single, nuclear family units to join an IBC residing in Ireland, not extending to secondary or subsequent families.\n\n---\n\n**Understanding Visa Requirements**\n\nFor Nigerian nationals, obtaining an Irish visa is compulsory for lawful entry, due to their non-visa exempt status under s. 4(3)(e) of the Immigration Act 2004. Despite having visas, the Ezenwakas\u2019 entry was denied, emphasizing the complexity of the 'public policy' clause under s. 4(3)(j), as analyzed by the court, highlighting its stringent interpretation concerning national security and societal welfare.\n\n---\n\n**Court Ruling on Policy and Admissibility**\n\nThe court contended that any decision to refuse admission on grounds of public policy should weigh heavily on the personal conduct of the immigrant, indicating a real, immediate threat to the state\u2019s critical interests. The court eventually ruled the refusal of entry to Ms. Ezenwaka and her children based on vague policy associations as unlawful. Additionally, they stated any policy needs to be implemented flexibly to account for individual circumstances without being unduly rigid.\n\n---\n\n**Work Permits and Specific Employment Classes**\n\nThe law provides various work permit categories including:\n\n- Standard employment permits for specific job categories\n- The Green Card for strategic and critical skills jobs\n- Work permits specific to nationals from Bulgaria and Romania under certain conditions\n- Intra-company transfers and business permissions for entrepreneurs with substantial investment potential\n- Specific considerations for refugees and their family members who are exempt from work permits\n\n---\n\n**Study and Research Permits**\n\nFor international students and researchers, specific permits enable them to engage in educational and research activities within the state, often including part-time work rights.\n\n---\n\n**Residency Requirements**\n\nDecisions on residency and the right to land are principally managed by immigration officers under various sections of the Immigration Acts, focusing primarily on the compliance with entry conditions detailed in s. 4(3).\n\nThe determination involves a complex interplay of various factors including the purpose of stay, the individual's immigration history, and adherence to national security and public policy standards. The rights to challenge residency refusals through judicial reviews add another layer of legal scrutiny.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThis guide highlights the intricate and multi-faceted nature of Irish Immigration Law, emphasizing the need for adherence to specific legal standards while also pointing towards the necessity for policies to be applied with reasonable flexibility, considering individual circumstances. The details provided herein are essential for NGOs and entities involved with assisting individuals navigating Irish immigration policies.",

Additionally, they stated any policy needs to be implemented flexibly to account for individual circumstances without being unduly rigid.\n\n---\n\n**Work Permits and Specific Employment Classes**\n\nThe law provides various work permit categories including:\n\n- Standard employment permits for specific job categories\n- The Green Card for strategic and critical skills jobs\n- Work permits specific to nationals from Bulgaria and Romania under certain conditions\n- Intra-company transfers and business permissions for entrepreneurs with substantial investment potential\n- Specific considerations for refugees and their family members who are exempt from work permits\n\n---\n\n**Study and Research Permits**",
            "---\n\n**Study and Research Permits**\n\nFor international students and researchers, specific permits enable them to engage in educational and research activities within the state, often including part-time work rights.\n\n---\n\n**Residency Requirements**\n\nDecisions on residency and the right to land are principally managed by immigration officers under various sections of the Immigration Acts, focusing primarily on the compliance with entry conditions detailed in s. 4(3).\n\nThe determination involves a complex interplay of various factors including the purpose of stay, the individual's immigration history, and adherence to national security and public policy standards.

        "text": "### Irish Immigration Law: An Introduction for Non-Governmental Organisations\n\n---\n\n#### UNDOCUMENTED MIGRANTS\n\nAs previously mentioned, section 4 of the Immigration Act 2004 grants the Minister for Justice, or an immigration officer on his or her behalf, the discretion to provide a non-Irish national with permission to land or be in the State and to impose conditions on such permission regarding employment engagement or stay duration as deemed appropriate.
